## XODS specific Code of Conduct (CoC):

Follow RoE as stated on server 99 discord.

Follow XODS specific CoC and RoE as outlined below.

We respect the dignity of others regardless of race, ethnicity, disability, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, etc., and do not tolerate discriminatory or marginalizing behavior towards others. While a 3 Strike Rule for XODS and server RoE is typical, actions that violate respectful behavior towards others *may* result in immediate removal from the alliance. Bigoted comments will result in immediate removal.

Basically, don't be a dick. 

Moderate trash talk is acceptable as long as it is game-related. Don't make it personal. This goes for all chats, including DM's. 

Shoot for positivity!

Please inform officers of issues with other players or alliances. Diplomacy is one of our main priorities and goals, and by letting us know about an issue, we can help keep it from spiraling out of control.

Help us help you ☺️

## XODS specific RoE

- Any RoE violations should be reported to them in the discord channel “stfc-roe-violations-only”
- Our members are required to take screenshots of Z-node hits.  **All screenshots must be posted in discord in the “stfc-znode” screenshots channel**. Failure to provide Z-node screenshots will result in a strike.
- Starbase Assaults are **ONLY** to be started with Officer approval. Starting an Assault without Officer approval will result in a strike.

**Territories:**
  - Any ship from anyone that is not an Ally in our territories can be blown up
  - Our guidelines for mining in Origin Space, aka Territories, are found here: [Mining in Territory](https://github.com/SpawnSPWN/SPWN/blob/main/TerritoryMining.md)
  - We ask any alliance to please send a message in embassy or a message in game that you will be entering territory for Q Trial events & we will do our utmost to respond quickly and notify in AC that you are not to be harmed
  - If any of our members have a Q Trial in a territory not owned by us we ask you to please send a message to the leadership of the alliance that owns it before heading into their territory

**UPC Miners:**
  - As stated in Server 99 Roe: UPC miners are protected by RoE and shall not be hit, including floating miners.
  - The exception is a miner that is in our Territories, or on a Z-node (in which case a screenshot is required for Z-nodes, as previously described). 
  - Hitting a non-Z-node UPC miner not in our territories will count as a strike.

**Absences**
  - If you are going to be away from the game for more than 3 days please let us know in the discord channel “stfc-absences” so we don't kick you out for inactivity.

**Incursions**
  - During Incursion, If your shield is down for 30 minutes or more and you are not raiding you may be kicked and invited back after Incursion is over on a case by case basis

Infractions to these guidelines will be discussed with the offenders, or applicable offender's alliance Admiral / RoE Officer, to discuss the best next steps.

**XODS has a 3 Strike Rule**. We will hold our players accountable for issues like no screenshots or RoE violations.

## Alliance Status Meanings

- **Allied** (*Purple Heart*): Do not hit for any reason. If they war, we war, and vice versa.
- **Friendly** (*Purple Spock Hand*): Abide by RoE, can hit OPC. Please only hit Z-Node if you need the node (and screenshots are still required). Bases, Autogrinders, Floaters, Territories, and Token Space are offlimits.
- **Civil** (*Blue circle with a slash in it*): We technically don't treat any different than neutral, but consider this a gateway to becomming NOT blood thirsty enemies.
- **Neutral** (*no mark*): Follow RoE.
- **Caution** (*Yellow Triangle*): Fire watch. Used to mark temporary enemy alliances during territory defense or takeovers, or to find someone. Continue following RoE.
- **Unfriendly** (*angry red face*): Made us angry. Hit them often, but follow RoE.
- **Enemy** (*Red Target*): At war. Full KoS (kill on sight). RoE does NOT apply. Armadas and Token Spaces may still be off limits, despite them being KoS so please ask an officer if it's ok to hit them before doing so.

**FOR ALL LABLES: TOKEN SPACES ARE OFF LIMITS UNLESS AN OFFICER SAYS OTHERWISE**

This is a copy of the RoE found in our discord. The version of RoE on discord is considered the primary authority if there are ever any discrepancies between the two. Please join the discord and check the RoE regularly to ensure you're up to date on the latest requirements.
