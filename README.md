## Welcome!

This repository is for information regarding the Exodus (XODS) alliance in Star Trek Fleet Command Server 99.

Please familiarize yourself with [Server and XODS Rules of Engagement (RoE) and Alliance Status Meanings](https://github.com/SpawnSPWN/SPWN/blob/main/RoE.md), what screenshots are required for [Z-node hits](https://github.com/SpawnSPWN/SPWN/blob/main/Z-node%20Screenshots.md), and our rules for [mining in Territory on Mining Mondays and during the rest of the week](https://github.com/SpawnSPWN/SPWN/blob/main/TerritoryMining.md).

We have a discord server, and the link to that is available through the Announcements section of the alliance page in game. There are five rooms/collections that are specific to STFC:
- stfc-resources (a collection of handy information and links)
- star-trek-fleet-command (the main chat room)
- stfc-roe-violations-only (reports and discussion about RoE violations)
- stfc-absences (notifications for absences)
- stfc-znodes (post all znode screenshots here)

And once you sign up for notifications (instructions below), you get access to two additional rooms for discussing and voting on stuff in a more private setting:
- stfc-star-wars
- stfc-star-wars-polls

This is Steve's professional discord, so the other rooms in the server should remain free from discussions about the game.

If you have any questions about RoE, please contact any officer in game or in the STFC rooms on discord.

Please change your server name to match your in-game name.

You can get notifications when people post with an @stfc in the discord rooms! Here are the steps:
