## Welcome!

This repository is for information regarding the Exodus (XODS) alliance in Star Trek Fleet Command Server 99.

Please familiarize yourself with [Server and XODS Rules of Engagement (RoE) and Alliance Status Meanings](https://github.com/SpawnSPWN/XODS/blob/main/RoE.md), what screenshots are required for [Z-node hits](https://github.com/SpawnSPWN/XODS/blob/main/Z-node%20Screenshots.md), and our rules for [mining in Territory on Mining Mondays and during the rest of the week](https://github.com/SpawnSPWN/XODS/blob/main/TerritoryMining.md).

We have a discord server, and the link to that is available through the Announcements section of the alliance page in game.
