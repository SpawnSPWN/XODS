### It is SPWN policy that screenshots of Z-node hits are REQUIRED *before* you hit a Z-node ship.

Screenshots must be posted in the "stfc-znodes" channel on discord, and the screenshots must follow the format shown below.

Communication will happen in Steve's discord server in the "stfc-roe-violations-only" room.

### How to take a Z-node screenshot:

STFC has differentiated what a node that has materials left looks like, from one that has been drained. Nodes that have materials left are brighter, while Z-nodes are duller.

The below image is an example of what the RoE Officer will expect as evidence if they request it. The information that needs to be shown in the screenshot is:
  - The node looking duller in color.
  - The name of the victim shown clearly.

The following is an example of a node that has vibrant color, showing that it still has material left in it. This is **NOT** an OK player to hit.

For znodes of Ore, Crystal, and Gas, you do not need to click on the node to bring up the node information. That obscures the name of the player sitting on the node.

For znodes of Isogen, Latinum, and other mining nodes that DO NOT show a change in color when at 0, then two screenshots are needed. The first being like the example above, and the second showing the pop-up box when you click on the node that says it is at "0".

If you have any questions about what is expected, please ask an Officer.
